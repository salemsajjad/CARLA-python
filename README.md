# CARLA-python
Here are my edited CARLA python codes that I derived from the main CARLA GitHub page: 
https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/PythonAPI/examples

I'm using this code to send a client the CARLA image grabbed from its camera via socket.
You can see both sender and receiver Python scripts in this repository.

I hope you're doing well.
