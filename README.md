# CARLA-python
Here are my edited CARLA python codes that I derived from the main CARLA GitHub page:

https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/PythonAPI/examples

I'm using this code to send a client the CARLA image grabbed from its camera via socket.
You can see both sender and receiver Python scripts in this repository.

I provided a text file named "CARLA_0.8.4_Windows.txt" which I've explained a full tutorial to install Carla on Windows on it. 

I hope you're doing well.
