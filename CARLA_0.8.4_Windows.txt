-- CARLA 0.8.4 activating on a Windows machine

1. Create a conda environment with Python 3.6.5 and activate it.
	$ conda create -n carla_env python==3.6.5
	$ conda activate

2. Extract the CarlaUE4Windows.zip to a folder in your desired disk.
   after the extraction, the Carla files will be in this path -> D:\<installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator

3. Now you should install Python dependencies with the requirements.txt provided in the Carla folder:
	$ python -m pip install -r D:\<installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator\requirements.txt --user

4. You can test the CARLA without the Python server using these commands:
	$ D:
	$ cd <installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator
	$ CarlaUE4.exe -windowed -carla-no-networking
   
   The default map loaded is ​Town01.
   Use the ​A, ​S, ​D, and ​W​ keys to manually drive the vehicle around the map.
   Use the ​Q​ key to toggle reverse and forward drive modes.
   Use the ​P​ key to toggle auto-pilot mode (this only works in maps with pre-defined roads,
    such as the ​Town01​ and ​Town02​ maps provided by CARLA)
   
   to load the Simulator with the Race Track Map you should use the following commands:
    $ D:
	$ cd <installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator
	$ CarlaUE4.exe /Game/Maps/RaceTrack -windowed -carla-no-networking
	
   to load the Simulator with a Fixed Time-Step you should use the following commands:
    $ D:
	$ cd <installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator
	$ CarlaUE4.exe /Game/Maps/RaceTrack -windowed -carla-no-networking -benchmark -fps=20
	
   to determine the quality level you can use the -quality-level=<level> flag which the <level> can be 
	Low or Epic

5. Testing CARLA in Server-Client Mode:
	First, you need to run the simulator in network mode( pause your firewall or add the 2000 port 
	 in your exception list)
	$ D:
	$ cd Coursera\CarlaSimulator
	$ CarlaUE4.exe /Game/Maps/Town01 -windowed -carla-server -benchmark -fps=20 -quality-level=Epic
	
	Then, in another terminal (or the same terminal), run the example Python client(​manual_control.py​):
	$ D:
	$ cd Coursera\CarlaSimulator\PythonClient
	$ python manual_control.py
	
	Note that in the server-client mode, the CARLA simulator window ​will not receive​ keyboard
     inputs (like in the previous examples without ​-carla-server​ enabled). Try clicking on the
     pygame window​ and manually drive the vehicle around, then try to do the same for the simulator.
	
	CARLA Python clients can be found in ​C:\<installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator\PythonClient.
	 CARLA by default provides ​several example clients​ on its website that are detailed in the link below.
	 These example client scripts are useful for demonstrating various features that CARLA has to offer.
	
	for other useful help please visit the vendor's website:
	 https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.4/connecting_the_client/
	 
6. How can you use another port for the server-client mode:
	To use another port (besides the default port of 2000), use the argument
     -carla-world-port=N​ for the CARLA Simulator script and ​--port=N​ for the Python client.
     Make sure to set the port number ​N​ to be the same for both the server and the client.
	
	Example:
	 
	 Server-side:
	 
	  $ D:
	  $ cd <installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator
	  $ CarlaUE4.exe -carla-server -Carla-world-port=2003
	 
	 Client-side:
	  
	  $ D:
	  $ cd <installation_directory>\CarlaSimulator\PythonClient
	  $ python manual_control.py --port=2003
